# 1. Motivation

I view a business as a support structure for implementing ideas/themes. Here is my full motivation:

```
I have understood a simple thing.

Business is a way to sustainably work towards an idea/goal, in a self sufficient manner

Examples - sustainable energy Tesla, and mass production for the goal of adoption.

Likewise, it's important to understand economics, and finance which is the implementation aspect/technology of 'value' in goods/services.
```

```
Business also helps in collecting real time data and iterating over products/services based on the idea that is to be implemented.

This real time feedback helps in fine tuning the algorithm and knowledge base of the idea's domain.
```

```
In short, if I wish to work towards an idea/theme, I should create a business around it.

Businesses are self sustaining systems, profit is a result not the goal.
```

```
To sum it up.

1. To work comfortably towards an idea --> Form business
2. To make a business, need domain work (research + development) + economics + finance  helped by sales (least priority thing, btw).
```
