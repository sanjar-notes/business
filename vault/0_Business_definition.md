# 1. Business Definition
Created Wednesday 13 July 2022

### Definition
The practice of working towards a goal, in an economically sustainable manner is called a business.

Note (optional):
- Businesses generally sell something of value (i.e. goods or services) to generate revenue that helps in keeping the business runinng. This is not the only way to make a business economically stable though.
- Isn't this definition too simplistic? See [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html/3#:~:text=when%20i%20asked%20musk%20about%20his%20knowledge%20of%20business%2C%20he%20scolded%20me%2C%20explaining%2C%20%E2%80%9Ci%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%20what%20a%20business%20is.%20all%20a%20company%20is%20is%20a%20bunch%20of%20people%20together%20to%20create%20a%20product%20or%20service.%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20such%20thing%20as%20a%20business%2C%20just%20pursuit%20of%20a%20goal%E2%80%94a%20group%20of%20people%20pursuing%20a%20goal.%E2%80%9D).

### Fundamental parts of a business
![business_definition_diagram](business_definition.drawio.svg)
Note: This definition just talks about the most fundamentals parts of a business, and not their dependencies viz funding, operations etc.

1. **Reason** - why is the business being done? Reasons can be classified as *one* of the following:
	1. **Need/problem** - the business is a solution to pressing problem, or satisfies some need. In short, the demand exists (as in supply and demand) or can be easily justified. e.g. food, energy, medicine are needs, garbage recycling is a valid problem.
	2. **Wish** - the business is a new kind of venture, whose demand is very low/non-existent, but it is important to a small number of stakeholders. Examples:
		1. Space exploration is neither a need of the majority nor a very imminent problem to be solved, but it is very desirable, exciting and should not be ignored.
		2. Smartphones were once a wish, not a need or problem. But manufacturers created them and demontrated that they could impact lives significantly, thus creating demand.
	3. **Need + wish combo** - this is a middle ground to the above facets of reason. The net demand is less but it's important to a large number of stakeholders.
2. **Work** - the work to be done. The components of work include:
	1. **Engineering** - the design of relevant goods/services. This also includes implementation work, but of prototypes only.
	2. **Feedback** - taking feedback in order to grow the business.
	3. **Production/implementation** - large scale production of the product, generally done in factories for physical products. In case large scale production is not a needed, this may refer to the implementation of the product design, e.g. programming/coding of software given design is ready.
3. **Market work** - letting people know of the product. This includes:
	1. Marketing - includes advertising, if needed.
	2. Sales

### My opinion about the facets
1. When many people accept a 'wish' as something to be excited about, and that 'wish' happens to solve some problems - the 'wish' gets normalized to a 'need'. e.g. computers, smartphones, internet. All these things started as a wish, and then gradually became normalized, so much so that they have become "pressing needs".
2. Market work is an important part of a business, but it is means to an end, of spreading awareness in society.
